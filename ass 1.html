    <h2>What is CSS ?</h2>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>CSS Stands for castcading style sheet</li><br>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML, elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in othe media.</li><br>
        <li><span class="nik">CSS is not necessary</span> <span class="ni">CSS a save a lot of work</span> .it can control the layout of multiple webpages all at once</li><br>
        <li><span class="K">External stylesheet are stored in CSS file</span> </li><br>

    </ol>
    <h1>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h1>
    <div><ul type="disc">
        <li>Inline- by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
        <li>Internal- by using a style elemnt in the head section</li>
        <li>External- by using a link element tyo link to an external CSS file</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS. is to keep the styles in external CSS files. however,<span class="la">in this tutitorial we will use 
            inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul></div>
    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID,the differnce is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID, on the other hand,applies a style to one unique 
        element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL.to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaSript.</p>
        
    <p1>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a webpage.Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the elements.</p1>
    <br>
    
    <br>
    <p2>There is a wide range of selectors avialable.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied
